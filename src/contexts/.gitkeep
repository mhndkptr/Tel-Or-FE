# /contexts

This folder stores React Context providers and related logic.

Examples:
- AuthContext for managing login state
- ThemeContext for dark/light mode
- Global settings or user preferences

Each context file should include:
- Context creation
- Provider component
- Custom hook (e.g., `useAuth`)
